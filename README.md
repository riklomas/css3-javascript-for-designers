This class is being held with [General
Assembly](http://www.galondon.com) and will be held on the 3rd of April
2012. You can buy tickets at <http://css3fordesigners.eventbrite.com/>.

This repo will cover any notes, code demos and slides that I'll be using to
put together the class.

## Course Description

If you're a designer working within the web industry, it gives you a big advantage to understand what you can do with the latest technologies available. This class will teach students the ins and outs of CSS3 and jQuery from a practical design perspective. You will learn how to use these techniques to help you get the best out of your designs and help you to become a stronger, more well-rounded designer.

The course will use demos and case studies to show how professional front-end developers build sites and we will cover topics like:

* The latest techniques in CSS3 such as 3D transforms, transitions and animations
* An introduction to Javascript and jQuery
* How to combine CSS and jQuery to achieve stunning effects

The course is aimed at designers and developers who have exposure to HTML and CSS. You don't need to have an advanced knowledge of front-end web development but you should understand how HTML and CSS work together. Laptops aren't necessary for the class but can be used to take notes.
